# wdnet 1.2.2

+ Removed a test involving `set.seed(); rpanet()` due to potential
  cross-platform inconsistencies.
+ Minor updates in testing scripts.


# wdnet 1.2.1

+ Minor fixes in documentation.
+ Added citation for the package.


# wdnet 1.2.0

## Interface

+ Moved the logical argument `directed` in `rpanet()` into `initial.network`;
  `rpanet(nstep = 1e4, initial.network = list(directed = TRUE))`.
+ Revised argument `isolates` in `clustcoef()` to accept binary input.
+ Removed the `distribution`, `dparams` and `shift` arguments from both
  `rpa_control_newedge()` and `rpa_control_edgeweight()`; the new argument
  `sampler` accepts a function used for sampling the number of new edges and
  edge weights.

## Printing

+ Updated `print.rpacontrol()` and `summary.wdnet()`.
+ Fixed a typo when printing the parameters of the default preference function.

## Minor changes

+ Removed sorting of nodes in the initial network from the `binary` method due
  to negligible performance gain.


# wdnet 1.1.0

+ Updated function interfaces now accept `wdnet` objects.
+ Added methods for `wdnet` and `rpacontrol` objects.

# wdnet 1.0.0

+ Updated function `rpanet`.
  + Renamed `seednetwork` to `initial.network` and changed `seednetwork = NULL`
  to `initial.network = list(edgelist = matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1))`;
  + Changed `control = NULL` to `control = list()`;
  + Renamed `naive` to `linear`; `nodelist` to `bag`; `edgesampler` to `bagx`;
  + Updated returns, put node strength and preference scores into a data frame.

+ Sort nodes from the seed network according to their preference scores before
  the sampling process.
+ Renamed `rpanet` control functions: `rpactl.foo()` to  `rpa_control_foo()`.
+ Renamed `cvxr.control()` to `cvxr_control()`.

# wdnet 0.0.5

## Minor changes

+ Updated returned items from `dprewire` and `dprewire.range`.
  + Removed solved `eta` and corresponding assortativity levels.
  + Added solver results from `CVXR`.
+ Allowed user-defined preference functions in `rpactl.preference`.

# wdnet 0.0.4

## Minor changes

+ Renamed internal C++ functions.
+ Edited `rpanet` with `binary` approach: renamed node structures (fix LTO issues).


# wdnet 0.0.3

+ First version of wdnet submitted to CRAN.
